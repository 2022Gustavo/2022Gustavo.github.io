<h1>The Finale</h1>
<hr>
<div>You press the button. You are then immediately told to go back to where you started and you do so without questioning how the machine knew this. Once you get back, you see a missile shoot up into the air, only to turn around and slam back into the island, destroying it. You feel like a hero for saving the world, and this helps you find comfort in your final moments. Loud and firey in one moment, dark and quiet in another. You have reached the Finale.</div>
