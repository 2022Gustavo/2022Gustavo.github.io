<h1>The Story</h1>
<hr>
<div>They begin to explain that they are the council of the seas. They have called you foward to speak with you. They explain that they've sent the Eel to retrieve you and that they are glad you decided to go back into the ocean. They tell you that you have been on this island for much longer than you think. You are shocked to hear that the Human Race has not been a thing for over 3000 years. Upon hearing this, you drop to your knees. The Eel tells you that you are destined to finally destroy the island, for it harbors are horrible evil power. You can't believe what you are hearing. You ask why the Human Race is gone. One of the council fish begins to tell you that the Island itself drove Humanity into extinction, despite their desperate tries to prevent this from happening. Anyways, they tell you that you need to take the right path in order to end all of this for good. They apologize that they need to wipe your memory and have you start from scratch. They all wish you good luck.</div>
