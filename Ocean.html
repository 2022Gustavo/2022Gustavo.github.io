<h1>The Ocean</h1>
<hr>
<div>So you decided to straight up go back into the ocean. Thats cool. You swim around and look at many different fish that appear before you. They all look cool. You see a Moray Eel, but you are unsure of what to do with it. You have a huge urge to pet it, but you aren't sure if you should do it.</div>
