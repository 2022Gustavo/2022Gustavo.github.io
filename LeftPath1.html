<h1>The Left Path</h1>
<hr>
<div>You take the left path and end up deeper in the jungle, but you find yourself in a spider's nest. But not just any spider's nest, for this nest belongs to the queen arachnid. She isn't home at the moment, but you feel like you should really leave before she comes home. However, you see sacs of......whatever it is and you realize you probably have time to peek into three of them and still have enough time to escape.</div>
