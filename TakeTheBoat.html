<h1>Take the freaking boat!</h1>
<hr>
<div>You argue to yourself for about 30.5 seconds and decide to take the boat. Once you get a pretty good distance away from the shore, the storm only gets worse. Your boat almost capsizes and you didn't think anything could get worse, but they are about to.</div>
