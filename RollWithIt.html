<h1>Roll with it</h1>

<div>You decide to go inside of the lighthouse anyways. You walk around, examining very antique things and decide to go to the top. There, you take a lovely look of the ocean until something catches the corner of your eye. You turn to see a note. It reads "To anyone reading this, you MUST destory this island. The evil itself is spreading and will destroy the entire world! I have been here for far too long, but I've gotten the kinks worked out. Unfortunately I don't have much time left in the living world and I am unable to press the button to end it all. Please, I beg of you! DESTORY THE ISLAND!"</div>
