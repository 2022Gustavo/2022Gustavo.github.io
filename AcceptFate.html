<h1>Accept your fate</h1>
<hr>
<div>You decide to accept your fate and stand there. The water hits very cold and you hate life for a couple of seconds. You countinue walking along the shoreline when you find a lighthouse. "YES" you thought. You begin to make your way there, but you realize you probably should walk around the whole island first just to be safe.</div>
